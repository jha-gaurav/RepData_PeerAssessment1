## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data1 <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings = "NA")
#Convert the date from character to a Date format
data1$date <- as.Date(data1$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

#Histogram of total steps taken each day

sum_agg <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data1[!is.na(data1$steps),], FUN = sum)
hist(sum_agg$steps, main = "Total Steps taken each day", xlab = "Steps")

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#Mean of the total steps taken each day
mean_agg <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data1, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
print(mean_agg)
```

``` {r, echo = TRUE}
#Median of the totoal steps taken each day
median_agg <- aggregate(steps ~ date, sum_agg, median)
print(median_agg)
#Time series plot of mean steps taken per day
with(mean_agg, plot(date, steps, type = "l"))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
``` {r, echo = TRUE}
#Compute the 5-minute interval that, on average, contains maximum number of steps
sum_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data1[!is.na(data1$steps),], FUN = sum)
print(sum_steps[order(sum_steps$steps, decreasing = TRUE),][1,])

```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
