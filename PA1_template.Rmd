```{r, echo = TRUE}

data1$date <- as.Date(data1$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean_agg <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data1, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
print(mean_agg)
with(mean_agg, plot(date, steps, type = "h"))

```
with(mean_agg, plot(date, steps, type = "h"))
